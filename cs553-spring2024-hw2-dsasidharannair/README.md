# Instructions

**Instructions for Running Benchmarks**

- Run Benchmarks by running the ./benchmark.sh file
- You will get a prompt to choose form of benchmarking
- Choose an option, sit back an wait for the autmoated benchmarking to complete
- The python scripts run as part of the automation process but you can check them out seperately as well

**Areas of Caution**

- Disk Benchmark takes a long time, did not get time to optimize it. I have functions that were supposed to help with that
- When running the network benchmark do not attach to the tmux sesssion that runs the servers and client for the VM and the container. It might just stop the execution (Random error)
- If any problems reach out to me through email
